                                "Shaykh Mohamed Almasmari, of Yemeni descent, was born and raised in Michigan. He memorized the Qur'an at a very early age and after high school, left to study at Sana'a University. Soon after, he obtained his Bachelor/Master Degrees in Islamic Law & Islamic Science from Yemen. During his studies, he was able to obtain ijaazas in recitation & teaching of Al-Qur'an, Qur'anic Exegesis (Tafseer-ul-Qur'an), Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), Sahih Bukhari & Muslim and Imam Nawwawi's works such as the commentary to Sahih Muslim and Riyaad-us-Saliheen. In 2007, he became the Imam of a local masjid in California few miles down from Shaykh Zaid Shakir, where he left a very high standard and tough shoes to fill. Then, In 2009, he was called upon to serve in Brooklyn in a community that was desperately in need of an Ameer (leader). Within two years, Alhamdulillah Shaykh Almasmari, by the Will of Allah swt was able turn that community around for the better. He has lead taraweeh prayers during the month of Ramadan since the age of 18. Now Shaykh Mohamed Almasmari is the Imam and Khatib at UMMA.”
